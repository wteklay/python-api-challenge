## WeatherPy

A Python script to visualzie the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator was created. Scatter plots to showcase the relationship between Weather Variables and Latitude was generated to showcase the following relationships:

* Latitude vs. Temperature
* Latitude vs. Humidity
* Latitude vs. Cloudiness
* Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Next, a linear regression for each realtionship was computed for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. 

## VacationPy

Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library was employed to create map visulaizations of humidity for every city in the DataFrame.
